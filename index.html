                Local Computer is the most picked when it comes to people’s choice while using a version  control method. This method allows the user to copy files into another place. This system is pretty simple, that is why many people pick it, but allows for a lot of errors. The reason for so many errors is because it is easy to forget which directory the user is currently in. Then they accidently write or copy the wrong files into somewhere they do not mean to. This actually holds one of the most popular version control system which is named RCS. RCS is actually seen in many of todays computers, like Mac OS X operating system. RCS is designed to keep patch sets in a particular format, that is special, on a disk then it can re-create any file that a user chooses and create the file to look like any of its past creations at any point by the patches. The patches are added all up to create what the user is looking for.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Centralized Version Control System, also known as CVCSs, were developed because many people encountered issues when they needed to collaborate with developers among other systems. CVS, Subversion, and Perforce which are the systems in centralized version control system have. These systems have on server that holds all versions of files and a list of who look or pull out files from the central place. This has been the standard for version control. Though this system has many advantages, it also has major downfalls. The one that stands out the most is the failure that the single centralized server represents. This means if the server goes down, during that time, no one can work or save version changes on anything they have worked on. If the hard drive or hard disk crashes then everything that everyone has worked on is gone except for the one snapshot that a worker might have on their local machine. If you put everything in one place, there is a risk to lose everything.

            <p class="lead">
                Distributed Version Control System, which is also known as DVCSs, was created help on the downfalls of centralized version control systems and local version control systems. This systems allows for clients to be able to fully mirror the repository, where you store things, rather than just allowing them to see the last snapshot of the file. This system is a god sin because if any server dies, the system were collaborating with the fried server, any repositories that a client has can be copied and backed up to a server to restore everything on it. The systems are normally clone, meaning that it has fully backup all of the data.

            <p class="lead">
                Cloning is a copy of an existing git repository. The code to clone is “clone”. It is not like other Version control systems, like subversion, where the code for it is “checkout”. This is pretty important because instead of getting a copy that works, git receives a complete copy of pretty much all of the data that server had on the file. Every file has the history on the server than is pulled down when the user runs git clone. This is huge benefit because if the server or server disk gets corrupted, the user can use any of the clones on any client to set the server to the state it was before it was corrupted. There is a chance to lose the server-side hooks, not all but some, but the versioned data would still be fine.

Committing is a when you are in the staging area and you have decided that it is the way you want it, you commit the changes you have made. If some things are not upstaged, meaning you did not change them and have not run the git add command, they will not go into the commit that you just did. They will sit as modified files on your server disk. Committing a record that is a snapshot that you, the user, set up in your staging area. You can always do another commit and add it to the history. Every time a user uses the commit command, they are recording a snapshot of the current project that they can revert or compare later.
